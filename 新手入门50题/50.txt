46、查询全部学生都选修的课程的课程号和课程名；
SELECT a.cname,
       b.cno
FROM
(SELECT cno,cname
FROM  course
) as a
RIGHT JOIN
(SELECT cno
FROM sc
GROUP BY cno
HAVING COUNT(sno) = (select COUNT(*) FROM student)
) as b
ON a.cno = b.cno


47、查询没学过“叶平”老师讲授的任一门课程的学生姓名；
SELECT SNO,sname as 学生姓名
FROM student
WHERE sno NOT IN 
(SELECT sc.sno
FROM sc,student,teacher,course
WHERE sc.sno = student.sno
   AND   course.tno = teacher.tno
   AND   sc.cno = course.cno
   AND   teacher.tname = "叶平"
)

48、查询两门以上不及格课程的同学的学号及其平均成绩；
SELECT sno,AVG(score)
FROM sc
WHERE score <60
GROUP BY sno
HAVING SUM(case when score < 60 then 1 END) >2

49、检索4号课程分数大于60的同学学号，按分数降序排列；
SELECT sno,score
FROM sc
WHERE score > 60
 AND cno = 4
ORDER BY score DESC

50、删除2号同学的课程1的成绩；
DELETE FROM sc
WHERE sno = 2
AND cno = 1;
