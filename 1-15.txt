     WHERE cno = 1) AS sc1,
     (SELECT sno,score
     FROM sc
     WHERE cno = 2) AS sc2
WHERE sc1.sno = sc2.sno
  AND sc1.score > sc2.score;

2、查询平均成绩大于60分的同学的学号和平均成绩
SELECT sno,AVG(score)
FROM sc
GROUP BY sno
HAVING AVG(score)> 60

3、查询所有同学的学号、姓名、选课数、总成绩
SELECT sc.sno,sname,COUNT(cno),SUM(score)																
FROM sc,student
WHERE sc.sno = student.sno
GROUP BY sc.sno

SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT tname)
FROM teacher
WHERE tname LIKE '李%'

5、查询没学过“叶平”老师课的同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno NOT IN (SELECT sno
     		  FROM course,teacher,sc						
                  WHERE course.tno = teacher.tno
	            AND course.cno =sc.cno
		    AND tname = '叶平')

6、查询同时学过课程1和课程2的同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno IN (SELECT sc1.sno
	      FROM (SELECT sno
		    FROM sc
		    WHERE cno = 1) AS sc1,
	           (SELECT sno
		    FROM sc
	            WHERE cno = 2) AS sc2
	     WHERE sc1.sno = sc2.sno)

7、查询学过“叶平”老师所教所有课程的所有同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno IN (SELECT sno
	        FROM course,teacher,sc
		WHERE course.tno = teacher.tno
		AND course.cno =sc.cno
		AND tname = '叶平')

8、查询 课程编号1的成绩 比 课程编号2的成绩 高的所有同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno IN  (SELECT sc1.sno
		FROM (SELECT sno,score
			FROM sc
			WHERE cno = 1) AS sc1,
		     (SELECT sno,score
			FROM sc
			WHERE cno = 2) AS sc2
		WHERE sc1.sno = sc2.sno
		AND sc1.score > sc2.score)

9、查询所有课程成绩小于60分的同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT sno
                  FROM sc
                  WHERE score > 60)

10、查询所有课程成绩大于60分的同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT sno
                  FROM sc
                  WHERE score < 60)

11、查询没有学全所有课的同学的学号、姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno NOT IN ( SELECT sno
		     FROM sc
		 GROUP BY sno
		 HAVING COUNT(sc.cno)< (SELECT COUNT(course.cno)
                                         FROM course)				    
                   )

12、查询至少有一门课程 与 学号为1的同学所学课程 相同的同学的学号和姓名
SELECT sc.sno,sname
FROM student,sc
WHERE student.sno = sc.sno
    AND sc.sno != 1
    AND cno IN (SELECT cno
                FROM sc
                WHERE sno =1)
GROUP BY sc.sno 

13、把“sc”表中“刘老师”所教课的成绩都更改为此课程的平均成绩
CREATE TABLE sc1(
sno INT NOT NULL, 
cno  INT NOT NULL, 
score  INT NOT NULL )

INSERT sc1
SELECT *
FROM sc

UPDATE sc
SET score = (SELECT AVG(score)
	       FROM sc1
            GROUP BY sc1.cno
	     HAVING sc1.cno = (SELECT c.cno
				FROM course AS c, teacher AS t
				WHERE c.tno = t.tno
				AND t.tname = '刘老师'))
WHERE cno IN (SELECT c.cno
		FROM course AS c, teacher AS t
		WHERE c.tno = t.tno
		AND t.tname = '刘老师');

--恢复sc
TRUNCATE TABLE sc;

INSERT INTO sc
SELECT *
FROM sc1;

--删除sc1
DROP TABLE sc1;

14、查询和2号同学学习的课程完全相同的其他同学学号和姓名
SELECT sno,sname
FROM student
WHERE sno IN (SELECT sno
              FROM sc
              GROUP BY sno
              HAVING sum(cno) = (SELECT SUM(cno)
                                 FROM sc
                                 GROUP BY sno
                                 HAVING sno = 2)
                AND sno != 2
               )


15、删除学习“叶平”老师课的sc表记录
CREATE TABLE sc1(

cno int NOT NULL ,
score int NOT NULL 
)

INSERT sc1
SELECT * 
FROM sc


DELETE FROM sc
WHERE cno = (SELECT cno
             FROM teacher,course
             WHERE teacher.tno = course.tno
              AND tname = '叶平')


TRUNCATE TABLE sc
INSERT sc
SELECT *
FROM sc1
